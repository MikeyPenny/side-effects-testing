### How to get rid of side effects

To get rid off side effects we have the next two options:

- **Spies**
- **Mocks**

**Spies**

Are wrappers around functions or empty replacements for functions that allow to track
if & how a function was called

**Mocks**

A replacement for an API that may provide some test-specific behavior instead
Also implement some test logic in the replacement function that does something else
than the original function but helps to test different scenarios.
